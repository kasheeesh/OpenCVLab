# OpenCV and Image Processing Assignments 🎨📸

Welcome to my **OpenCV and Image Processing Assignments Repository**! This repository contains various assignments and projects related to computer vision and image processing, implemented using Python and OpenCV. Each task is designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCV in handling image transformations, feature extraction, and other image processing techniques.



## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Open Source Computer Vision Library for image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing images and results.

## 📝 **Assignments Overview**

### **Assignment 1: Image Transformations**
- **Description**: Perform basic image transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, cropping, and shearing.
- **Tasks**:
  - Translate images by specific offsets.
  - Rotate images at various angles.
  - Resize (scale) images to new dimensions.
  - Reflect images across x, y, or both axes.
  - Crop a region of interest from images.
  - Apply shearing transformations along the x and y axes.
